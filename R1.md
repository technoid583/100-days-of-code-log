# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [technoid583]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [June 8, Saturday, 2024].

## Log

### R1D0: June 12, 2024

**Today's Progress**: (Step - 65) Started to learn JS from now on. Learnt about variables, data types, arrays, `console.log(), array.push(), array.pop()` `for` loops, `functions`, parametrs, arguments and much more. 

**Thoughts:** 

_Today Is Difficult, Tomorrow Is Much More Difficult, But The Day After Tomorrow Is Beautiful. — Jack Ma._

I just wanted to start out my thoughts by this quote 'cuz its relatable with my current personal situation. Roger, I don't wanna talk about any personal thing here, I'm just here for code nothing more. Writing down anything else non-coding is unnecessary.

It's just Day 0, and I feel the heat of this challenge. A couple of days later, I hope to make some progress.

### R1D1: June 13, 2024

**Today's Progress**: (Step - 77) Learnt about calling a `function`, calling a function with arguments, _off-by-one error_, comments, addition assignment, _increment operator (++)_

**Thoughts:** IDK why, but it was hard to concentrate, sit down and code. Too many distractions. I need to find my peace first. Find quiet time & place.

However, I found useful resources across the web, there we go — [Free e-book Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) and [Modern JavaScript Tutorial - Javascript.RU](https://learn.javascript.ru)

### R1D2: June 14, 2024

**Today's Progress**: (Step - 96)

 `if` conditions, truthy value, falsy value, `else if`, `else` `while` loops, infinite loop, equality operator (==), strict equality operator (===), strict inequality operator (!==) and so on.

**Thoughts:** I had little environmental issues today so I couldn't concentrate no more than 2hrs. I even hadn't even read the book - *Eloquent JavaScript.*

### R1D3: June 15-16, 2024

**Today's Progress**: (Step - 107) Practicing with loops, reverse `for` loop [code here], subtraction assignment (-=), decrement operator (--)

#### .unshift() and .push():

`.unshift()` —  unlike `.push`, adds a value at the beginning of the array.

*`.push()` — adds a value at the end of the array.

 P.S: both `.unshift()` & `.push()` methods returns the new length of the array when its logged.

#### .shift() and .pop():

`.shifted()` — alike `.pop()` but removes the first element of the array.

*`.pop()` — removes the last element of the array.

P.S: both `.unshift()` & `.push()` methods returns the new length of the array when its logged.


**Thoughts:** Learnt about things above and for addition tried to read about `.pop()` at the [developer.mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/pop), created a cheatsheet above for better understanding, struggled with time management & some emotional suffer.

### R1D4: June 17, 2024

**Today's Progress**: (Step - 117) uncommenting, practiced using booleans as a flag to check. [you can see code below given as an snippet from the project]

``` javascript
let inverted = true;

for (let i = 1; i <= count; i++) {
    if (inverted) {
        rows.unshift(padRow(i, count));
    } else {
        rows.push(padRow(i, count));
    }
}
```
Completed Pyrdamid-Generator project. Heres the code for note.

#### Project | Pyrdamid-Generator
``` javascript
const character = "#";
const count = 8;
const rows = [];
let inverted = true;

function padRow(rowNumber, rowCount) {
  return " ".repeat(rowCount - rowNumber) + character.repeat(2 * rowNumber - 1) + " ".repeat(rowCount - rowNumber);
}

for (let i = 1; i <= count; i++) {
  if (inverted) {
    rows.unshift(padRow(i, count));
  } else {
    rows.push(padRow(i, count));
  }
}

let result = ""

for (const row of rows) {
  result = result + "\n" + row;
}

console.log(result);
```

**Thoughts:** I need to start being competitive this time. If I don't, I think I'm going to lose focus, slow down, and so on. Keep the discipline!

### R1D5: June 29, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed the last project. Wrote code in JS by myself and finished the _Gradebook App._ 

#### Project | Gradebook App
``` javascript
function getAverage(scores) {
  let sum = 0;

  for (const score of scores) {
    sum += score;
  }

  return sum / scores.length;
}

function getGrade(score) {
  if (score === 100) {
    return "A++";
  } else if (score >= 90) {
    return "A";
  } else if (score >= 80) {
    return "B";
  } else if (score >= 70) {
    return "C";
  } else if (score >= 60) {
    return "D";
  } else {
    return "F";
  }
}

function hasPassingGrade(score) {
  return getGrade(score) !== "F";
}

function studentMsg(totalScores, studentScore) {
  return "Class average: " + getAverage(totalScores) + ". Your grade: " + getGrade(studentScore) + (hasPassingGrade(studentScore) ? ". You passed the course." : ". You failed the course.");
}
console.log(studentMsg([92, 88, 12, 77, 57, 100, 67, 38, 97, 89], 37));

```

Started building _Role Playing Game_, Reviewed all the previous lessons.

**Thoughts:** I was at the trip (18th - 28th of June) with no tech, no phone, no PC. The last day that I stayed active was 17th of June, It's been 11 days technically. So I think I'm back on the track at the current time.

### R1D6: June 30, 2024

**Today's Progress**: (Step - 16) Continued building _Role Playing Game_, Introduction to DOM, `querySelector()` etc.

**Thoughts:** It was late like 1AM. And I had little conditional problems.

### R1D7: July 01, 2024

**Today's Progress**: (Step - 45) Continued building _Role Playing Game_, Practicing with DOM, and declaring elements in code with `querySelector("#")`, `onclick` property.

**!Note:** _You can access properties in JavaScript a couple of different ways. The first is with dot notation. Here is an example of using dot notation to set the onclick property of a button to a function reference._ example: `button.onclick = myFunction;`.

The `innerText` property, _The innerText property controls the text that appears in an HTML element. For example:_
``` html
<p id="info">Demo content</p> 
```
``` javascript
const info = document.querySelector("#info"); 
info.innerText = "Hello World"; 
```
TL;DR: Working with properties above and practicing functions and DOM.

**Thoughts:** -

### July 06, 2024
I have had some **mental breakdown** recently and still, hard to concentrate, unwillingness to engage even in activities that I like, high stress and pressure. So I did no progress, none these days (July 02-06th.) Now I'm going to work on on "debt mode", I should pay off for the days that I wasn't disciplined.
