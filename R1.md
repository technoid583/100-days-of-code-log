## Log

### R1D0: June 08, 2024

**Today's Progress**: Started to learn JS from now on. Learnt about variables, data types, arrays, `console.log(), array.push(), array.pop()` and more.

**Thoughts:** 

_Today Is Difficult, Tomorrow Is Much More Difficult, But The Day After Tomorrow Is Beautiful. â€” Jack Ma._

I just wanted to start out my thoughts by this quote 'cuz its relatable with my current personal situation. Roger, I don't wanna talk about any personal thing here, I'm just here for code nothing more. Writing down anything else non-coding is unnecessary.

It's just Day 0, and I feel the heat of this challenge. A couple of days later, I hope to make some progress.
